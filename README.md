# testconnect

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

* **USB Host Mode Requirement**
  When connecting, make sure the target device’s USB settings choose **“controlled by → this device”** so it functions as a host.

* **Current Progress & Next Steps**
  • Connection and package-listing via ADB-OTG are fully implemented.
  • We’re now migrating additional ADB-SafeScan features into this codebase, and adding wireless connection & scan support through Termux.
